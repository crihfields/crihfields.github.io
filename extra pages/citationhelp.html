<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Citation is a minimum requirement when using research in  your writings.  Correct citations are not  a haphazard guideline in writing but an absolute.  There are many methods of citation and many  professors and colleges require a specific system.  The most common methods of citation are MLA  and APA.   MLA is used in researching  literature and APA is used in the social sciences.  Purchasing an updated guide is a good  idea.  It is not necessary for this  course but will be necessary in college.  </p>
<p>I suggest using the website that is linked on my website  Citation Machine.  There are many others  and all may be used but stay with one style.   Wikipedia.com also gives full citations for APA citations.  Look on the left menu when you have found  your topic.  </p>
<p>The following items must be cited every time they are used  in your paper or essay.  </p>
<ol>
  <li>direct  quotes</li>
  <li>pictures  or photos</li>
  <li>numbers  or any statistics</li>
  <li>ideas  and concepts</li>
</ol>
<p>Direct quotes must be in quotation marks and the author and  date immediately following.  If the quote  is longer than three lines of text the complete quote is indented 5 spaces,  single spaced, without quotation marks, and cited.  Photos, pictures, or other images must be  cited near to the image.  Numbers and  other statistics are cited at the end of the sentence or chart.  Ideas and concepts can be placed after the  sentence or the end of a paragraph if all the information comes from one  source.  Paragraphs could have all for of  the above citations in the same paragraph.   It is better to over cite than to under cite.  </p>
<p>Citations in APA are the author and the date of  publication.  Websites seldom have  authors so there are additional rules for them.   The subject and the year retrieved is the most common.</p>
<p>To make the paper less choppy another method may be used  instead of placing the citation at the end of the sentence.  Examples of this:</p>
<p>According the McDaniel and Littlefield (2007) the best of  times are found on the stage.</p>
<p>The joy found on the stage states McDaniel (2007) is often  the continuing lure for the actor.</p>
<p>Sean Gignac (2006) states “that life working at a minimum  wage job is an incredibly hard life”.</p>
<p>All of the above information pertains to in body  citations.  Failure to cite in this  manner is plagiarism and the best possible grade will be a 59%.  A format grade to follow the correct format  is included in all papers.  It will be  10% of most grades.  </p>

<p align="center"><strong>(Chains,  2007)                              (Slaves  in chains, 2007)   </strong></p>
<p><strong>	Slavery  is defined in the United    States as “</strong><strong>the state of being under the control of another person  or the practice of owning slaves.” (Dictionary, 2007)  According to Appleby et al (2005) Virginia had the highest  enslaved population, while Pennsylvania  and Connecticut  had the least.</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>Over  500,000 Africans were transported to North America  before the American international slave trade ended in the 1808. (Appleby,  Brinkley, Broussard, McPherson, &amp; Ritchie, 2005) Slavery was well accepted  in the southern colonies especially on plantations where the people had labor  to do.  Many Southerners did not own  slaves but still supported the slave system as a Constitutional right.  The typical slave owner owned no more than  one slave.  (Crihfield public lecture,  2007)</strong><br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Slavery is a theme of this time period because it  caused many conflicts.  Slavery is also  one of the major causes of the Civil War.   The northern colonies were separated from the southern colonies because of  slavery.  Slavery was very customary for  the southern plantation owners, while in the north they found it cruel and they  didn’t want it to exist.  The south,  having lots of work to do and not wanting to do it because of heat force the  slaves to do it. They thought it was the only way to keep up the fields and get  things done.  Additionally slavery was  one of the most gruesome things during this time period.  Slaves were chained together, forced to stay  in small areas and they got very little to eat.   They were forced through many of the most unbearable conditions.  Due to the fact that slavery was such a big  issue it was definitely a theme of this time period.</strong></p>
<p> All references are listed at the end of the essay or  paper.  Failure to include this section  in the paper is plagiarism.  The section  is labeled References.  This is centered  and placed at the top of the reference page.   All citations that follow are in alphabetical order.  The format is a hanging indent and double  spaced between entries.</p>
