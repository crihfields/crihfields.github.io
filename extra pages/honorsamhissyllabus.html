The student needs to get the class name and  password from the instructor to submit their paper for this class.  The document can only be submitted once so be  sure that all parts of your paper are in ONE document, written in word, and are  submitted during the open week that the paper is due.  After the student submits the document it  will take from a few minutes to a few hours to complete the process.  The student can check the submission but the  determination of plagiarism is made by the instructor.  If the student sees that they have made an  error in citation and it is not past the due date the student can make the  corrections on the hard copy of the paper and note the changes made by placing  a note on the title page as to the corrections.</strong></p>
