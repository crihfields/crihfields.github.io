<p><strong>The  student should be ready for all class assignments.  No late assignments will be accepted without  a school excused admit for the absence.   All papers must be submitted toTurnitin.com no later than class time the  day it is due.  Absence from school does  not change this rule.  Turnitin.com will  be open a week before the paper is due.   If the student is absent from school the day a paper is due the paper  must be submitted via e-mail no later than class time the date the paper is  due.  When the student returns to school  with a valid admit a hard copy of the paper must be given to the instructor.   Monitor the website calendar to check due  dates for assignments.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com  is a website that all papers must be submitted to before the paper is  accepted.  The site helps the instructor  check the paper for plagiarism.  The  student needs to register on the site and if the student is registered for  another class they do not need to re-register.   After the student registers the student does not need to do anything  else till the paper is submitted. The student needs to get the class name and  password from the instructor to submit their paper for this class.  The document can only be submitted once so be  sure that all parts of your paper are in ONE document, written in word, and are  submitted during the open week that the paper is due.  After the student submits the document it will  take from a few minutes to a few hours to complete the process.  The student can check the submission but the  determination of plagiarism is made by the instructor.  If the student sees that they have made an  error in citation and it is not past the due date the student can make the  corrections on the hard copy of the paper and note the changes made by placing  a note on the title page as to the corrections.</strong></p>
