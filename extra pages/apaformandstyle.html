<p>Document  your study throughout the text by citing by author and date the works you used  in your research. This style of citation briefly identifies the source for  readers and enables them to locate the source of information in the  alphabetical reference list at the end of the article. (See sections 4.03 to  4.15 on the preparation of the reference list.) </p>
<p>Include  the surname of the author and the year of publication that are inserted in the  text at the appropriate point: <br />

<h3>Electronic media</h3>
<p>*Using  and citing Internet sources should observe the following two guidelines:<br />
  1.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Direct readers as closely as possible to the  information being cited—whenever possible, reference specific documents rather  than home or menu pages.<br />
  2.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide addresses that work.</p>
<p>*A  reference of an Internet source should provide a document title or description,  a date (either the date of publication or update or the date of retrieval), and  an address (in Internet terms, a uniform resource locator, or URL). Whenever  possible, identify the authors of a document as well.<br />
